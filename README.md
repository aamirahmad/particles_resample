A simple code to demonstrate differences between

1. Naive resampling technique
2. Low variance resampling

Usage:

1. Simply create a make file by running 'cmake .' and then then run 'make'
2. 2 executables are created, one for each kind of resampler. Simply execute them without any additional params. One execution, the prompt will ask you to input the number of particles. That's it!
